# HoldMyCards
This is the source code of my first Android app.
The purpose of this app is for creating a virtual wallet of your credit cards.
This app was made using Android Studio (Java and XML) and Adobe XD (for the design).
This app is connected to the Firebase servers.
For previews of the app check the .jpg files and the attached video.
